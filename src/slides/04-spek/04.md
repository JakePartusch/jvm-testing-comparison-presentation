## Assertions
- No built in assertions
- Some Kotlin specific 3rd party libraries like [hamkrest](https://github.com/npryce/hamkrest)
- JUnit-based libraries still work
```kotlin
describe("addition") {
    it("should return the sum") {
        val sum = calculator.add(2, 4)
        assertThat(sum).isEqualTo(5) //AssertJ
    }
}
```
